# Feature Tracking and Backlog

Feature tracking repo for Skygear releases

This repo only contains issues. Each issue track a new feature might be added to Skygear. Features can be voted by :thumbsup: on the issue. Feel free to suggest new feature but please looks for existing one before opening new issue.

## What is a Feature?

A feature is anything that:

- a blog post would be written about after its release
- requires multiple SDKs/components changes
- needs significant effort or changes Skygear in a significant way (ex. something that would take 10 person-weeks to implement, introduce or redesign a system component, or introduces API changes)
- users will notice and come to rely on

It is unlikely a feature if it is:
- fix a unit test or bugs
- refactoring code
- performance improvements
- adding error messages

## When to Create a New Feature Issue

Create an issue here once you:
- have written (or plan to write) the specification or design of the feature
- (optionally) have done a prototype in your own fork

Please comment on the feature issue to:
- request a review or clarification on the process
